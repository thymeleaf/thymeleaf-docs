 * This removes the links at the end of each footnote. These link are rendered
 * by Pandoc with a U+21A9 unicode character, which does not exist in the
 * downloaded fonts. This causes WebKit to default to Lucida Sans Unicode for
 * rendering this char, and therefore the entire Lucida Sans Unicode font to be
 * included in the PDF output files, just for rendering one char. Given these
 * links are in fact useless in PDFs, it is better to just remove the links
 * completely by setting display to none.
